# Find-A-Flick

- Find-A-Flick is a movie finder app developed by myself and a team of peers. The app has a focus on users who would like to discover films (old or new) based on their user input and filter through selection criteria. 		
- The application developed is largely based around accessing a database of films through an API, and enables end users to find and filter through a plethora of films based on their user input. 		
- Find-A-Flick is developed with React (functionality), React Router (navigation) and React Bootstrap (styling).
