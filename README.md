# Find-A-Flick

- Find-A-Flick is a movie finder app developed by myself and a team of peers. The app has a focus on users who would like to discover films (old or new) based on their user input and filter through selection criteria. 		
- The application developed is largely based around accessing a database of films through an API, and enables end users to find and filter through a plethora of films based on their user input. 		
- Find-A-Flick is developed with React (functionality), React Router (navigation) and React Bootstrap (styling). For further links to the Github of this project consult the top of this C.V. 		
- Working on a project like this afforded the chance to work as a part of a team and employ SCRUM techniques, as well as developing oneâ€™s skills in accessing a database through an API, programming with React.js in the JSX syntax and creating a UI for a mobile interface.		
- The role I took on for this app was two-fold. The popular page  of the app was largely coded by myself, filters data from an API based on user input and conditionally renders it to screen. On top of this I worked on the frontend design of the app using React bootstrap. For further information and grade achieved on this project, consult the appendix.
